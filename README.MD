# Star Wars Aurebesh Calendar

I created this project to practice HTML and CSS. I decided to use a png file, like a sprite sheet, to translate the calendar into Aurebesh.

I learned how to change the size of the sprite characters by using the CSS transform scale property.

```css
transform: scale(1.35);
```

I also learned how to change the initial black color of the png font by using the filter property by using invert, sepia, saturate, and hue-rotate.

```css
filter: invert(5%) sepia(50%) saturate(0%) hue-rotate(0deg);
```

Finally, I used the drop-shadow property to create a font shadow effect.
